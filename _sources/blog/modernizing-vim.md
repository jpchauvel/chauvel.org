In the world of code editors, Visual Studio Code (VSCode) has gained immense
popularity for its rich feature set and seamless developer experience. However,
Vim, a classic and highly customizable text editor, can be transformed into a
powerhouse IDE comparable to VSCode with the right configuration and plugins.
In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into modernizing Vim for Python
development, database queries, and more, utilizing tools like Conquer of
Completion (CoC), `coc-pyright`, `vim-dadbod`, and `vim-dadbod-ui`.

## Introduction to Vim Modernization

Vim, known for its speed, lightweight footprint, and extensive customization
options, has a steep learning curve compared to more beginner-friendly IDEs
like VSCode. By incorporating plugins and configurations that enhance Vim's
functionality, developers can enjoy the best of both worlds: Vim's efficiency
and VSCode's feature-rich environment.

## Setting Up Conquer of Completion with Vim

Conquer of Completion (CoC) is a versatile autocompletion engine that brings
intelligent code suggestions, linting, and type checking to Vim. To get
started, install CoC using a package manager like Vim-Plug:

### Installing Vim-Plug for Package Management

Vim-Plug is a minimalist Vim plugin manager that simplifies the process of
installing and managing plugins within Vim. To set up Vim-Plug for your Vim
editor, follow these steps:

1. [**Download
   Vim-Plug**:](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim)
Before you can begin using Vim-Plug, you'll need to download the plugin manager
script. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
    ```

2. **Configure Vim**: Make sure that Vim is aware of the downloaded Vim-Plug
   script. You can do this by adding the following line to your `~/.vimrc` file:

    ```vim
    call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
    ```


4. **Update Plugins**: To update your installed plugins, launch Vim and run the
   following command:

    ```vim
    :PlugUpdate
    ```

5. **Save and Restart Vim**: After adding or updating plugins, save your
   `~/.vimrc` file and restart Vim for the changes to take effect.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage your Vim plugins using
Vim-Plug, enhancing your development environment with additional features and
capabilities.

```{note}
It's important to note that the choice of using the Vim-Plug package manager in
this post stems from its popularity and ease of use among the Vim community.
While there are other package managers available for Vim, such as Vundle or
Pathogen, the decision to focus on Plug was made to streamline the installation
process for readers unfamiliar with Vim plugin management. This article aims to
provide a practical and beginner-friendly approach to modernizing Vim, and
leveraging the straightforward nature of Plug contributes to achieving that
objective.  Different users may have varying preferences when it comes to
package managers, and the author's selection of Plug is intended to facilitate a
smooth and accessible transition into enhancing Vim's capabilities.
```

### Installing Conquer of Completion

```vim
Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', {'branch': 'release'}
```

After installing CoC, you can enhance Python development by incorporating the
`coc-pyright` plugin. Run the following command within Vim to install
`coc-pyright` for optimal Python support:

```vim
:CocInstall coc-pyright
```

## Elevating Python Development in Vim

With CoC and `coc-pyright` in place, Vim becomes a robust platform for Python
development. Experience advanced autocompletion, linting, and type checking
features directly within Vim as you work on Python scripts and projects.

## Integrating `vim-dadbod` for Database Queries

For database-focused tasks, Vim can be equipped with `vim-dadbod`, a plugin
that allows seamless execution of database queries within the editor. Install
`vim-dadbod` using Vim-Plug for easy database interaction:

```vim
Plug 'tpope/vim-dadbod'
```

With "vim-dadbod" configured, you can set up database connections and execute
queries with ease, all without leaving the comfort of Vim.

Example:
```vim
:DB postgres://postgres@localhost/postgres
```

## Enhancing the Database Experience with `vim-dadbod-ui`

For a more visual and interactive database interface, consider installing
`vim-dadbod-ui`. This plugin complements `vim-dadbod`, providing a
user-friendly environment for managing and executing database queries.

```vim
Plug 'kristijanhusak/vim-dadbod-ui'
```

To open the UI just type the following command:
```vim
:DBUI
```

By combining `vim-dadbod` with `vim-dadbod-ui`, you can transform Vim into a
capable tool for working with databases efficiently.

## Enhancing the Database Query Experience with `coc-db`

To further enhance the database query capabilities in Vim when using plugins
like `vim-dadbod` and `vim-dadbod-ui`, you can install the `coc-db` plugin for
Conquer of Completion (CoC). This plugin adds database query completion features
and enhances the overall database interaction experience within the Vim editor.

### Installing `coc-db` for Conquer of Completion

You can install the `coc-db` plugin alongside other plugins for CoC within Vim.
Run the following command within Vim to add the `coc-db` plugin:

```vim
:CocInstall coc-db
```

Once installed, `coc-db` will provide intelligent database query completions,
syntax highlighting, and helpful suggestions while working on database-related
tasks within Vim. This complements the functionality of `vim-dadbod` and
`vim-dadbod-ui`, creating a seamless and efficient database management
environment directly within Vim.

## Final Thoughts: Vim vs. VSCode

While VSCode boasts a wide range of features out of the box, Vim's strength
lies in its extensibility and robust customization capabilities. By integrating
plugins like CoC, `coc-pyright`, `vim-dadbod`, and `vim-dadbod-ui`, Vim can be
upgraded to offer comparable functionality to VSCode, tailored to individual
preferences and workflows.

In conclusion, Vim's journey to modernization involves harnessing the power of
plugins and configurations to create a tailored development environment. By
leveraging the versatility of Vim and embracing its rich ecosystem of plugins,
developers can optimize their workflow, enhance productivity, and transform Vim
into a versatile IDE that rivals mainstream editors like VSCode.
